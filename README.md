# Jaaag-Bot
## Introduction-
Jaaag is a [discord](https://discord.com/) chatbot written in python using the [discord.py library](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

If you already are a discord user, then please consider inviting the instance of the bot that I host, [here](https://cutt.ly/zzh5AGh)

## Before you get started...
* The bot caters to discord, so you need to know how stuff and the norms of discord. [This is a beginner's guide to discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord)
* You also need to see the [discord.py docs](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is the python library the bot is built on, to better understand the code.

## Aknowledgements-
* [Rapptz](https://github.com/Rapptz), the owner of discord.py
* All the youtube channels that helped me learn python and make this bot:
  * [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ)
  * [Carberra Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC13cYu7lec-oOcqQf5L-brg)
  * [MenuDocs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpGGFqJP9vYvzFudqnQ-6IA)
  * [vcokltfre](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4FkT5Yeigrxwp1OE6ovlgw)
  * [Lucas](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR-zOCvDCayyYy1flR5qaAg)
  * [Code With Swastik](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2ITRZ4_Di-KMHSIylTQbBA)
  * [Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg)

## Note-
* This is not the original repository for the bot, so it doesn't have all the commits that were in the old repo. The original repo got deleted because it was a pretty big mess. 

* Please don't judge the code within this repository too harshly, I'm only a beginner. ðŸ˜…

* The current code in this repository hasn't been touched in a week and clearly isn't well documented. I will update that in a few days as currently I'm busy with trying to intergrate an external database, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) to be exact, to allow for more complex commands and features.
