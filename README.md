# Jaaag-Bot
## Introduction-
Jaaag is a [discord](https://discord.com/) chatbot written in python using the [discord.py library](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

If you already are a discord user, then please consider inviting the instance of the bot that I host, [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=816034868899086386&permissions=8&scope=bot)

## Before you get started...
* Since the bot caters to discord, you might need to know the stuff and the norms of discord. [This is a beginner's guide to discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord)
* You also need to see the [discord.py docs](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is the python library the bot is built on, to better understand the code.
