# Jaaag-Bot
## Introduction-
Jaaag is a [discord](https://discord.com/) chatbot written in python using the [discord.py library](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
If you already are a discord user, then please consider inviting the instance of the bot that I host, [here](https://cutt.ly/zzh5AGh)

## Before you get started...
* the bot caters to discord, so you need to know how discord works. [This is a beginner's guide to discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord)
* you also need to see the [discord.py docs](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is the python library the bot is built on, to better understand the code.
